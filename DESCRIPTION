Description: Calculates and maps the Escape Route Index (ERI), a spatially
    explicit measure of evacuation capacity in wildland environments. The ERI
    is a useful spatial decision support metric for determining where to (and
    where not to) direct wildland firefighters and associated resources to 
    ensure a safe and effective response.
